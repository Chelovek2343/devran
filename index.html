    <h2>Number 1</h2>
    <h3>Drake-What Did I Miss?</h3>
    <p class="homeles">Drake reflects on betrayal by close friends during his feud with Kendrick Lamar. He questions how
      people he trusted ended up siding with his enemies. The song has a cold, emotional tone, and Drake expresses
      disappointment and confusion, asking: "What did I miss?"

      It's about loyalty, fake friends, and the pain of realizing who's really with you.

    <h2>Number 2</h2>
    <h3>BigXthaPlug - All The Way feat. Bailey Zimmerman</h3>
    <p class="homeles">All The Way” is about a tough breakup. The message: if you’re leaving, don’t do it halfway —
      just go all the way. The narrator is tired of lies and emotional games and wants a clean, final end.

      BigXthaPlug shares his pain and frustration, while
      Bailey Zimmerman sings the emotional hook — asking not to be let down easy, but to be left completely so healing
      can begin.

      The song blends heartfelt country with raw Southern hip-hop, creating a vibe that’s both emotional and honest.</p>

    <h2>Number 3</h2>
    <h3>Clipse,Pusha T & Malice - So Be It</h3>
    <p class="homeles">The song “So Be It” is about life at the top — money, luxury, and power. Pusha T talks about how
      he and Clipse
      have made it big, and warns anyone who challenges them that if you want smoke, so be it — be ready for the
      consequences.

      No Malice adds a deeper layer with reflections on faith, spirituality, and inner struggles, showing that behind
      the fame and wealth, there are moral questions too.

      At the end, Pusha throws a subtle diss at Travis Scott for betrayal — calling out how Travis wasn’t honest and
      tried to play games in the music business.

      Overall, it’s a strong, confident track about success, loyalty, personal battles, and sending a warning to anyone
      who stands in their way.</p>

    <h2>Number 4</h2>
    <h3>Clipse,Kendrick Lamar,Pusha T & Malice - Chains & Whips</h3>
    <p class="homeles">“Chains & Whips” is about how money and power can become traps — not freedom, but chains that
      hold you down and suffocate you.
      Pusha T talks about people chasing wealth and status, only to end up slaves to their own desires and ambitions.
      No Malice brings in spirituality — saying real strength and freedom come from within, not from material things,
      and money can’t save you from your inner demons.
      Kendrick Lamar adds the social layer — about how the system oppresses Black communities, leaving wounds passed
      down through generations, making it hard to break free.

      In the end, the song is a powerful reflection on freedom, struggle, and how true liberation lives in the soul, not
      in the chains of wealth or power.

    <h2>Number 5</h2>
    <h3>Eminem & JID - Animals (pt-1)</h3>
    <p class="homeles">“Animals (Pt. 1)” is a fierce rap battle where JID and Eminem show off their skills and
      aggression.
      JID kicks it off with sharp metaphors, comparing his words to weapons, flexing his achievements, and keeping the
      energy high.
      Eminem follows up with powerful flow, touching on his career and dropping provocative lines that shook the
      internet.
      The whole track feels like a hunt — a fight of beasts for their place, no mercy, just predators and prey.

      It’s a song for those who love real, hard-hitting rap with smart lyrics and zero compromises.

      <h2>Number 6</h2>
      <h3>Kendrick Lamar - Not Like Us</h3>
      <p class="homeles">“Not Like Us” is a hard diss aimed at Drake, where Kendrick calls him out for betrayal, lies,
        and stealing culture.
        He says Drake’s fake, plays dirty, and breaks moral codes.
        Kendrick shows he’s different — real, honest, with strong values, ready to stand up for truth.
        The song is a challenge and a statement: he’s not like the others and won’t bow down to the system.

        It’s a track about fighting for honesty and true identity in a world full of lies and betrayal.

      <h2>Number 7</h2>
      <h3>Young Dolph - 100 Shots</h3>
      <p class="homeles">“100 Shots” is about how Young Dolph got shot at a hundred times — and survived.
        He laughs at his enemies: “How the f** you miss a whole hundred shots?”*
        He’s not scared — he’s got money, protection, a loyal crew. He’s the boss.
        The song is a message to his haters: you tried to kill me, and I’m still here, shining even harder.

        It’s an anthem of survival, strength, and street pride.</p>

      <h2>Number 8</h2>
      <h3>Travis Scott - Da Wizard</h3>
      <p class="homeles">In "DA WIZARD", Travis Scott portrays himself as a "wizard" — a mystical, almost untouchable
        figure in the world of rap. The song blends braggadocio, surreal imagery, drug symbolism, and status flexing.
        He’s not just a rapper; he’s someone who can bend reality, influence culture, and mesmerize listeners — like a
        sorcerer.

        He crafts an aura of power and mystery, using hypnotic flows and vivid metaphors to position himself as a
        larger-than-life presence. References to lean, snow (cocaine), and reptilian imagery create a cold, controlled,
        and almost supernatural persona. The “wizard” title isn’t just flair — it’s a declaration of his mastery over
        sound, mood, and influence.

      <h2>Number 9</h2>
      <h3>21 Savage - Redrum</h3>
      <p class="homeles">In the song "Redrum," 21 Savage talks about the harsh life on the streets, where violence and
        death are a part of everyday reality. The word "Redrum" is "murder" spelled backward, immediately setting a dark
        and dangerous tone. The main themes include life in constant danger, always being ready for conflicts and
        betrayal. The rapper describes violence and revenge, showing how he deals with enemies, protects himself and his
        close ones, and isn’t afraid to use force. The world he portrays is cold and ruthless, and survival requires
        being strong and unemotional. Additionally, surrounded by lies and deceit, 21 Savage keeps only trusted people
        close and doesn’t let anyone in easily.

      <h2>Number 10</h2>
      <h3>Central Cee & 21 Savage - GBP</h3>
      <p class="homeles">In the song "GBP," Central Cee and 21 Savage rap about the hustle and challenges of street
        life, where money, loyalty, and reputation are everything. The title "GBP" refers to the British Pound,
        symbolizing wealth and success, but also the pressure to maintain status. The track explores themes of ambition
        and survival, highlighting the constant grind to rise above difficult circumstances. Both artists touch on the
        importance of trust, warning against fake friends and betrayal. The song reflects a world where danger is always
        present, but strength, focus, and loyalty help them stay ahead.</p>
